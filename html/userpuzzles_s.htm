	Problem: Two trains enter a tunnel 200 miles long (yeah, its a big tunnel) 
	travelling at 100 mph at the same time from opposite directions. as soon as 
	they enter the tunnel a supersonic bee flying at 1000 mph starts from one 
	train and heads toward the other one. as soon as it reaches the other one it 
	turns around and heads back toward the first, going back and forth between 
	the trains until the trains collide in a fiery explosion in the middle of 
	the tunnel (the bee survives). how far did the bee travel? 
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
		Solution: The tunnel is 200 miles long. the trains meet in the middle 
		travelling at 100 mph, so it takes them an hour to reach the middle. the 
		bee is travelling 1000 mph for an hour (since its flying the whole time 
		the trains are racing toward one another) - so basically the bee goes 
		1000 miles.

		Problem: two MIT math grads bump into each other at Fairway on the upper 
		west side. they haven&#39;t seen each other in over 20 years. the first grad 
		says to the second: &quot;how have you been?&quot; second: &quot;great! i got married 
		and i have three daughters now&quot; first: &quot;really? how old are they?&quot; 
		second: &quot;well, the product of their ages is 72, and the sum of their 
		ages is the same as the number on that building over there..&quot; first: 
		&quot;right, ok.. oh wait.. hmm, i still don&#39;t know&quot; second: &quot;oh sorry, the 
		oldest one just started to play the piano&quot; first: &quot;wonderful! my oldest 
		is the same age!&quot; How old are the daughters? 

</TD></TR><TR><TD>


		Solution: solution: Start with what you know. you know there are 3 
		daughters whose ages multiply to 72. let&#39;s look at the possibilities... 
		Ages: Sum of ages: 1 1 72 74 1 2 36 39 1 3 24 28 1 4 18 23 1 6 12 19 1 8 
		9 18 2 2 18 22 2 3 12 17 2 4 9 15 2 6 6 14 3 3 8 14 3 4 6 13 after 
		looking at the building number the man still can&#39;t figure out what their 
		ages are (we&#39;re assuming since he&#39;s an MIT math grad, he can factor 72 
		and add up the sums), so the building number must be 14, since that is 
		the only sum that has more than one possibility. finally the man 
		discovers that there is an oldest daughter. that rules out the &quot;2 6 6&quot; 
		possibility since the two oldest would be twins. therefore, the 
		daughters ages must be &quot;3 3 8&quot;.

		Problem: five pirates have 100 gold coins. they have to divide up the 
		loot. in order of seniority (suppose pirate 5 is most senior, pirate 1 
		is least senior), the most senior pirate proposes a distribution of the 
		loot. they vote and if at least 50% accept the proposal, the loot is 
		divided as proposed. otherwise the most senior pirate is executed, and 
		they start over again with the next senior pirate. what solution does 
		the most senior pirate propose? assume they are very intelligent and 
		extremely greedy (and that they would prefer not to die). (to be clear 
		on what 50% means, 3 pirates must vote for the proposal when there are 5 
		for it to pass. 2 if there are 4. 2 if there are 3. etc... )

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

		Solution: Most of the time people answers like &quot;the most senior pirate 
		takes half and divides the rest up among the least senior pirates.&quot; um, 
		you missed the whole point to begin with. Sorry. any answer without a 
		specific logic behind it is invalid.

<p>If I ask you why pirate 5 gave x coins to pirate 1, please don&#39;t say &quot;because 
he&#39;s nice&quot;. Now for the real solution. Pirate 5 being the most senior knows that 
he needs to get 2 other people to vote for his solution in order for him not to 
be executed. so who can he get to vote for him, and why would they choose to 
vote for him?
</p>
<p>If you start thinking that pirate 4 will never vote for him, because he would 
rather have 5 die and then be in charge and take it all for himself, you are on 
the right track. But it gets more complicated. lets consider if there were only 
1 pirate. Obviously he would take it all for himself and no one would complain. 
If there were 2 pirates, pirate 2 being the most senior, he would just vote for 
himself and that would be 50% of the vote, so he&#39;s obviously going to keep all 
the money for himself. If there were 3 pirates, pirate 3 has to convince at 
least one other person to join in his plan. So who can he convince and how? </p>
<p>Here is the leap that needs to be made to solve this problem. Pirate 3 
realizes that if his plan is not adopted he will be executed and they will be 
left with 2 pirates. He already knows what happens when there are 2 pirates as 
we just figured out. Pirate 2 takes all the money himself and gives nothing to 
pirate 1. So pirate 3 proposes that he will take 99 gold coins and give 1 coin 
to pirate 1.</p>
<p>Pirate 1 says, well, 1 is better than none, and since I know if I don&#39;t vote 
for pirate 3, I get nothing, I should vote for this plan. now we know what 
happens when there are 3 pirates. so what happens with 4? Well pirate 4 has to 
convince 1 other person to join in his plan. he knows if he walks the plank then 
pirate 3 will get 99 coins and pirate 1 will get 1 coin. Pirate 4 could propose 
giving pirate 1 two coins, and surely pirate 1 would vote for him, since 2 is 
better than 1. But as greedy as he is, pirate 4 would rather not part with 2 
whole coins. He realizes that if he gets executed, then pirate 3&#39;s scenario 
happens and pirate 2 gets the shaft in that scenario (he gets zero coins). So 
pirate 4 proposes that he will give 1 coin to pirate 2, and pirate 2 seeing that 
1 is better than 0 will obviously vote for this plan.

</p>
<p>A common objection is that pirate 2 is not guaranteed to vote for this plan 
since he might hope for the case when there are only 2 pirates and then he gets 
all the booty. But that is why I said that the pirates are extremely 
intelligent. Pirate 2 realizes that pirate 3 is smart enough to make the optimal 
proposal, so he realizes that there will never be 2 pirates left, because 3 
doesn&#39;t want to die and we just showed that 3 has a winning proposal. So lets 
sum up at this point Pirate.</p>
<p>Pirate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5==&gt; ?&nbsp; ?&nbsp; ?&nbsp; ?&nbsp; ? </p>
<p>Pirate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4==&gt; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0 99</p>
<p>Pirate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3==&gt; 1&nbsp; 0 99&nbsp; -&nbsp; - </p>
<p>Pirate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2==&gt; 0 100 -&nbsp; -&nbsp; - </p>
<p>Pirate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1==&gt; 100 </p>
<p>Once you see the pattern it becomes very clear. You have to realize that when 
a pirate&#39;s plan does not succeed then that means you are in the same situation 
with one less pirate.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pirate 1 needs 0 other people to vote for him. So he votes for himself and 
  takes all the money. 
  </li>
  <li>Pirate 2 needs 0 other people to vote for him. so he votes for himself and 
  takes all the money. Pirate 1 gets 0.</li>
  <li>Pirate 3 needs 1 other person to vote for him. He gives 1 coin to pirate 1 
  for his vote - if we are reduced to 2 pirates, pirate 1 gets 0 so pirate 1 
  knows 1 is better than none. Pirate 3 takes 99. pirate 2 gets 0. </li>
  <li>Pirate 4 needs 1 other person to vote for him. He gives 1 coin to pirate 2 
  - if we reduce to 3 pirates, pirate 2 gets 0 so pirate 2 knows 1 is better 
  than none. Pirate 4 takes 99. Pirate 3 gets 0. Pirate 1 gets 0. </li>
  <li>Pirate 5 needs 2 other people to vote for him. Its clear now that the 2 
  people he needs to convince are the 2 who get shafted in the 4 pirate scenario 
  - pirate 3 and pirate 1. So he can give them each 1 coin (which is better than 
  0 - what they would get otherwise) and keep 98 for himself.


  </li>
</ol>
<p>Pirate 5==&gt; 1&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0 98
</p>
<p>What happens, if there are 15 pirates? Pirate 15 needs 7 other people to vote 
for him, so he recruits pirates 13,11,9,7,5,3, and 1 with 1 coin each and keeps 
93 coins himself. Those pirates will all vote for him because they know that 
they get 0 coins If he dies and pirate 14 is in charge.

		Problem: A bad king has a cellar of 1000 bottles of delightful and very 
		expensive wine. a neighboring queen plots to kill the bad king and sends 
		a servant to poison the wine. (un) fortunately the bad king&#39;s guards 
		catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle. alas, the 
		guards don&#39;t know which bottle but know that the poison is so strong 
		that even if diluted 1,000,000 times it would still kill the king. 
		furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect. the bad king decides 
		he will get some of the prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the 
		wine. being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder no more than 
		10 prisoners - believing he can fob off such a low death rate - and will 
		still be able to drink the rest of the wine at his anniversary party in 
		5 weeks time. Explain how?

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

		Solution:

<p>1000 is less than 1024. If there were 1024 or more bottles of wine it would 
take more than 10 prisoners. number the bottles 1 to 1000, and write the number 
in binary format. </p>
<p>Bottle 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 0000000001 bottle 250&nbsp; = 0011111010 bottle 
1000 = 1111101000 now take your prisoner&#39;s 1 through 10 and let prisoner 1 take 
a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in its least significant bit. let prisoner 
10 take a sip from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit. etc. </p>
<p>Prisoner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 bottle 924&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 1 1 
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 for instance, bottle #924 would be sipped by 10,9,8,5,4 and 3. 
That way if bottle #924 was the poisoned one, only those prisoners would die.
</p>
<p>After four weeks, line the prisoners up in their bit order and read each 
living prisoner as a 0 bit and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit. The number that 
you get is the bottle of wine that was poisoned. </p>
<p>Additional question: To increase your chance of living, which prisoner would 
you want to be? If there were 1023 bottles, it wouldn&#39;t matter since everyone 
would have to take 512 sips. but there are 23 bottles less, so the people whose 
bits would have been on from 1001 to 1023 won&#39;t have to take a sip. 1001 is 
[11111 01001] in binary and 1023 is [11111 11111]. The most five significant 
bits are the most interesting because they would always be on from 1001 to 1023, 
so all those people are missing out on 23 bottles of wine that they otherwise 
would have had to drink. So in order to increase your chance of living, you&#39;d 
probably want to be prisoner 6 to 10. (But depending on how the king determines 
who is least significant and who is most significant you could get shafted.) 
Note that if the king was really trying to kill the least number of prisoners, 
he should have let 999 prisoners each take a sip from their respective bottle 
numerically (If he had that many prisoners at his disposal). That way only one 
prisoner would die, and there&#39;s a chance of 1/1000 that no one would die, but 
then the puzzle isn&#39;t very fun.

		Problem: a mad bomber is out on the job, making bombs. He has two fuses
